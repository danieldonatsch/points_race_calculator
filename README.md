# Calculator For Points Race Results

*DSICLAIMER* This is a hobby project and also a Cursor AI-coding test. All the code is actually written by some LLMs through the editor Cursor.

## What's A Point Race?

A point race is a race where athletes (skaters, cyclists, etc.) compeed on a race course over several laps. 
After some laps, the pattern is previously defined, sprints take place and the sprint winner and second placed athlete earn points.
Usually, the winner gets two, the runner-up one point.
On the finish line, i.e. after the last lap, usually more points are awareded.
For example, three points to the winner, two points for the runner-up and one point for the third place.
The winner of the race is the athlete who collects the most points over all sprints.

## What Does This Software Do?

The website then displays fields to enter the starting numbers of the athletes who earn points.
Further, it shows a ranking, which number (athletic) has currently to most points and also the points history.
